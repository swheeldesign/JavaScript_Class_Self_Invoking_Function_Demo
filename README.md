# JavaScript_Class_Self_Invoking_Function_Demo
Demonstrating that a class in JavaScript can be instantiated inside a self-invoking function and used as a property of that function.
---
I wanted to see if a class in JavaScript that is declared outside of a self-invoking function can be instantiated and used as a property of the said function.

---
In the  Testing_self_invoking_functions_and_html_window_space branch, I added a .HTML file that tested to see if a class instantiated in a self-invoking function could access another class as a window property.
